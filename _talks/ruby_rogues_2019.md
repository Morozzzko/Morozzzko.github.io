In [Ruby Rogues episode #407](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/rr-407-functional-programming-in-ruby-using-dry-gems-with-igor-morozov/) we discussed functional programming in Ruby. I talked about the tools I use every day, and the ideas behind them. We also discussed the application of functional programming in an object-oriented language and the reasons to use different paradigms in Ruby.
