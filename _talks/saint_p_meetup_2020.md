On the last Thursday of October, 2020 I gave a talk at [Saint P Ruby Community](https://t.me/saintprug), the same community which organizes [Saint P RubyConf](https://spbrubyconf.ru/).

My talk's name was «Модель С4. Зачем нам моделировать архитектуру». I roughly translate it as "C4 model. Why do we need to model architecture".

In this talk I introduced the audience to the four definitions of software architecture and illustrated how those definitions apply to every day work.

* The one given in [Synopsys blog](https://www.synopsys.com/glossary/what-is-software-architecture.html)
* Definition from [ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2011](https://www.iso.org/standard/50508.html)
* Two definitions by Marin Fowler and Ralph Johnson, published in [Fowler's blog](https://martinfowler.com/ieeeSoftware/whoNeedsArchitect.pdf)

Afterwards, I've assessed our "usual" approaches to software architecture:

* When do we need it
* What kind of tasks do we perform while _working on the architecture_
* What problems do we usually face

I've proposed a solution to some of the problems — to develop a mental model which will help with discovery, planning, visualization and presentation of the architecture. I suggested [C4 model](https://c4model.com/) as a starting point.

Afterwards, I've illustrated how the model easily gives us a natural way to think about architecture. The same technique enables us to illustrate architecture with no technology except for pen and paper.
